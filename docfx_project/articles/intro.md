# CSharp To Mindustry Logic
This is a code transpiler that will transpile C# code to mlog.  
This transpiler is highly documented.  
Currently, this is just a console application and only support **windows**.
## How to install
You will need an IDE that can open `.csproj` for auto-completion.  
If you do not have one, I recommand visual studio,  
It can be downloaded [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com).

Goto [release](https://github.com/SmolIndieGame/CSharp-To-MLog/releases), download the latest version  
Open `Code Translator.lnk` and select the code you want to transpile.

[here] is a video tutorial.
